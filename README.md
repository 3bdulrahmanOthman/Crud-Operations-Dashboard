# üõçÔ∏è Advanced E-Commerce Dashboard with Next.js, Shadcn UI, NextAuth, and Zustand

üöÄ **Welcome to the E-Commerce Admin Dashboard Repository!**  
This project was initially built as a frontend challenge by [@Abdo-112002](https://github.com/Abdo-112002) and has evolved into a fully-featured eCommerce dashboard using modern technologies, advanced UI patterns, and best practices.

---

## üìå Project Vision  
After completing the initial challenge, I decided to scale the project into a complete admin dashboard that simulates a real-world eCommerce CMS with the following goals:  
‚úÖ Build full CRUD interfaces for **products**, **categories**, and **users**  
‚úÖ Provide a dynamic **overview dashboard**  
‚úÖ Implement full **authentication system** (Sign In / Sign Up) with multiple authentication providers  
‚úÖ Ensure **responsive design** and modern UI/UX  
‚úÖ Use caching & API strategies to improve performance and scalability
